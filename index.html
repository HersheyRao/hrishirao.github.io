    <h2>Artifact 1: League of Legends Challenger Data Science Tutorial</h2>

    <h3>Contextual Statement</h3>
    <p>
      This artifact is a data science tutorial website I built for CMSC320 that walks through the full data science pipeline using the then current official League of Legends Challenger dataset. I pulled data from the Riot Games API for all 300 North American Challenger players, cleaned it into a pandas dataframe, and then walked through exploratory analysis, visualizations, and basic machine learning modeling. The site is written as a step by step notebook style guide so a reader can see the raw API pulls, the code to shape the data, and the final plots and statistics in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project shows that I can handle the technical side of data science and explain it in an understandable way. In this project, I had to manage API rate limits, design models for the data, and then use pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn to explore relationships like win rate versus league points, total games played, and veteran status. I also had to decide which results actually mattered, and not just dump graphs on the reader. Lastly, I used various machine learning models on the data in order to attempt to further understand the relationships between these variables. In addition, the write up forces me to translate code and numbers into plain language so that someone who cares about League of Legends but is not a data scientist can still follow what is going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This artifact fits my portfolio because it combines something I actually care about, high level League of Legends play, with legitimate work in data science. It shows I can take an open ended question, build my own dataset, and carry it from collection to interpretation without being spoon fed instructions. It also shows that I am comfortable presenting technical work in a public facing format, which is important for jobs where you have to communicate results to non technical people.
