    <h2>Artifact 1: League of Legends Challenger Data Science Tutorial</h2>

    <h3>Contextual Statement</h3>
    <p>
      This artifact is a data science tutorial website I built for CMSC320 that walks through the full data science pipeline using the then current official League of Legends Challenger dataset. I pulled data from the Riot Games API for all 300 North American Challenger players, cleaned it into a pandas dataframe, and then walked through exploratory analysis, visualizations, and basic machine learning modeling. The site is written as a step by step notebook style guide so a reader can see the raw API pulls, the code to shape the data, and the final plots and statistics in one place.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project shows that I can handle the technical side of data science and explain it in an understandable way. In this project, I had to manage API rate limits, design models for the data, and then use pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn to explore relationships like win rate versus league points, total games played, and veteran status. I also had to decide which results actually mattered, and not just dump graphs on the reader. Lastly, I used various machine learning models on the data in order to attempt to further understand the relationships between these variables. In addition, the write up forces me to translate code and numbers into plain language so that someone who cares about League of Legends but is not a data scientist can still follow what is going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This artifact fits my portfolio because it combines something I actually care about, high level League of Legends play, with legitimate work in data science. It shows I can take an open ended question, build my own dataset, and carry it from collection to interpretation without being spoon fed instructions. It also shows that I am comfortable presenting technical work in a public facing format, which is important for jobs where you have to communicate results to non technical people.

    <h3>Contextual Statement</h3>
    <p>
      This artifact is a roguelite dungeon game my group built for CMSC425 using Unity 6 and C#. The player spawns in a maze, fights bats and golems, and picks an augment after clearing the room. We made almost everything using basic Unity shapes and textures we drew ourselves. The goal was to build a simple dungeon environment that still fit a fantasy theme. We also used ideas from class like tremble effects for the bats and basic audio changes for the attacks and environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maze is created with a procedural system that starts with one room in the center and then places several more around it in a grid. Each room prefab has openings on four sides. When a new room is placed, the generator checks if the entrances line up. If the room is on the outside edge, unused openings are filled with walls so the layout still makes sense. The game also randomizes the number of enemies and where they spawn inside each room. Some rooms might only have a couple of bats, while others can have a mix of bats and golems spread across the space. This keeps the layout and the difficulty different every time the player loads in. Inside the rooms, the bats move unpredictably and fire magic at random, while the golems walk around until the player gets close and then chase. The movement and enemy behavior are simple but work well together, and the augment system gives the player different options for how to approach later rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      This artifact fits my portfolio because it shows I can work on a full game loop, not just small pieces. It includes level generation, enemy randomness, enemy behavior, player upgrades, and the basic visuals needed to tie everything together. It also shows that I can think about how players experience the game, not only whether the code runs. The project required programming, teamwork, and attention to how the systems fit together, and it produced a playable result that someone can understand immediately.
